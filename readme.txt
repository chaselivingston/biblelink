Bible Link uses a [bible] shortcode to parse Bible references and create links for them back to http://bible.com

== Description ==

Bible Link uses a [bible] shortcode to parse Bible references and create links for them back to http://bible.com. Currently it supports single verses only, and links to the ESV translation.

Usage example: [bible]John 3:16[/bible] would create a link to Bible.com that looks like https://www.bible.com/bible/esv/john.3.16.esv

== Installation ==

1. Upload `biblelink.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the [bible]Reference[/bible] syntax in a post or a page to create the link, where Reference is a reference to a single Bible verse.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't books with numbers work quite right? =

I'm working with the developers at http://bible.com to try and get this sorted out.

= How do I use the shortcode? =

Example: [bible]John 3:16[/bible] would create a link to John 3:16 at http://bible.com.
